## Introduction

The report can be found at [EPA1361_G1_Report.pdf](report/EPA1361_G1_Report.pdf) in the [report](report) directory.

## How to Use

To run the model processes, navigate to the following Jupyter Notebook files in the [final assignment](../final_assignment) directory:
* [00_Open_Exploration.ipynb](00_Open_Exploration.ipynb): Open Exploration


* [01_0_Directed_Search_Baseline.ipynb](01_0_Directed_Search_Baseline.ipynb): Directed Search Baseline

* [01_1_Directed_Search_Worsecase.ipynb](01_1_Directed_Search_Worsecase.ipynb): Directed Search Worstcase

* [01_2_Directed_Search_Bestcase.ipynb](01_2_Directed_Search_Bestcase.ipynb): Directed Search Bestcase


* [02_Directed_Search_Merged_Outputs.ipynb](02_Directed_Search_Merged_Outputs.ipynb): Directed Search outputs from baseline, worstcase, and bestcase merged


* [03_Directed_Search_Scoring_Filtering.ipynb](03_Directed_Search_Scoring_Filtering.ipynb): Directed Search


* [04_Directed_Search_Scoring.ipynb](04_Directed_Search_Scoring.ipynb): Directed Search

## Output

The outputs from the model can be found in the [directed_search](output/directed_search/), [open_exploration](output/open_exploration/), and [optimization_moro](output/optimization_moro/) folders in the [output](output) directory.

## Data

The input data can be found at [dikeIjssel_alldata.xlsx](data/dikeIjssel_alldata.xlsx) in the [data](data) directory.

## Folders

* [data](data/): Input data for the data cleaning and the model


* [output](output/): Output data from the model for open exploration and directed search


* [preliminary_experiments](preliminary_experiments/): Preliminary experiments including moro optimization 


* [report](report/): Report prepared for the Transport Company including a policy recommendation and political reflection
